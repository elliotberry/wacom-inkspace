# React Intl Redux

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) binding for [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl).

Building idiomatic React Redux Application by
having translations in store and dispatching action to update it.

## Installation

```
npm install react-intl-redux react react-intl react-redux redux --save
```

## Usage

<!-- eslint-env browser -->
<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { FormattedNumber } from 'react-intl'
import { Provider, intlReducer } from 'react-intl-redux'
import reducers from '<project-path>/reducers'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  ...reducers,
  intl: intlReducer,
})

const store = createStore(reducer)

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <FormattedNumber value={1000} />
  </Provider>
)

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('container'))
```

### Provide `locale` and `messages` on load

You should provide a different `locale` and `messages` if your user is not using `en` locale.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef, no-unused-vars -->

```js
const initialState = {
  intl: {
    locale: 'it',
    messages: {
      'app.greeting': 'Ciao!',
    },
  },
  // ...other initialState
}
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState)
```

Refer to the [`initial-locale` example](https://github.com/ratson/react-intl-redux/tree/master/examples/initial-locale) for more details.

### Switch `locale` and `messages` on request

You could also switch `locale` on user's request by dispatching `updateIntl` action.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
import { updateIntl } from 'react-intl-redux'

store.dispatch(updateIntl({
  locale,
  messages,
}))
```

React Intl in browsers only contain locale data for basic English
by default, see
[Loading Locale Data](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki#loading-locale-data)
for loading locale data in browsers.

### `Provider` vs `IntlProvider`

In most cases, `react-intl-redux` will be wrapped immediately after `Provider` from `react-redux`. For convenient, `react-intl-redux` provides `Provider` to do that for you.

However, if you don't want it, you could do it manually via [`IntlProvider`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/Components#intlprovider). For example,

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
import React from 'react'
import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl-redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <IntlProvider>
      <App />
    </IntlProvider>
  </Provider>
)
```

### Formatting Data

`react-intl` provides two ways to format data, see the [official docs](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki#formatting-data).

To change `formats` through [React components](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/Components),

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
import { updateIntl } from 'react-intl-redux'

store.dispatch(updateIntl({
  locale,
  formats,
  messages,
}))
```

### Use with `redux-immutable`

See the usage in [test](https://github.com/ratson/react-intl-redux/blob/master/test/immutable.spec.js).

### TypeScript Support

This module does not ship with types definitions by itself, but there is community contributed [`@types/react-intl-redux`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-intl-redux) package.

## Examples

There are some examples under the [`examples`](./examples) folder for reference.

## Troubleshooting

1. Why my connected component does not update after locale change?

  By default, `locale` is used as `key` for `IntlProvider`, which will trigger re-render when locale changes, things should just work.

  If it doesn't, here are few solutions could be tried,

  * Do a `forceUpdate` after changing locale.
  * Mark the connecting compoent `{pure: false}`.
  * Pass `locale` in `props`.
  * Set `key` when dispatching `updateIntl`.
  * Provide custom `intlSelector` for `IntlProvider`.

2. How to use `intl` in asynchronous action?

  A simple solution would be retrive `intl` object using [`injectIntl`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/API#injection-api) and pass it in the action payload.
